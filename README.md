# Full-Stack-Web-Development
This is my solution for Full Stack Web Development course at https://fullstackopen.com 
The course is organized by University of Hensinki in corporated with Houston Inc.
The course containt knowledge about React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB and GraphQL. It introduce to modern JS-based web development.
The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

## Course contents:
### Part 0: Fundamentals of Web apps
 In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the practicalities of taking the course.
After that we will have an overview of the basics of web development, and also talk about the advances in web application development during the last few decades.
### Part 1: Introduction to React
In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of Javascript that are important for understanding React.
- Introduction to React
- Javascript
- Component state, event handlers
- A more complex state, debugging React apps
### Part 2: Communicating with server
Let's continue our introduction to React. First, we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.
- Rendering a collection, modules
- Forms
- Getting data from server
- Altering data in server
- Adding styles to React app
### Part 3: Programming a server with NodeJS and Express
In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.
- Node.js and Express
- Deploying app to the Internet
- Saving data to MongoDB
- Validation and ESlint
### Part 4: Testing Express servers, user administration
In this part, we will continue our work on the backend. Our first major theme will be writing unit and integration tests for the backend. After we have covered testing, we will take a look at implementing user authentication and authorization.
- Structure of backend application, introduction to testing
- Testing the backend
- User administration
- Token authentication
### Part 5: Testing React apps, custom hooks
In this part we return to the frontend, first looking at different possibilities for testing the React code. We will also implement token based authentication which will enable users to log in to our application.
- Login in frontend
- props.children and protypes
- Testing React apps
- Custom hooks
### Part 6: State management with Redux
When applications grow larger, state management should be moved outside React-components. In this part, we will introduce the Redux-library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React-applications.
- Flux-architecture and Redux
- Many reducers, connect
- Communicating with server in a redux application
### Part 7: React router, styling app with CSS and webpack

### Part 8: GraphQL
